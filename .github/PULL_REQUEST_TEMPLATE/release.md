### Release checklist
- [ ] The [config.ini](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/blob/master/src/sqlfluff/config.ini) is up to date.
- [ ] Changes have been copied from the [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/releases) to [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
- [ ] The `skip-changelog` label has been added to this Pull Request so it's not added to the Release Notes.
- [ ] I'm ready to publish the new release on GitHub.
